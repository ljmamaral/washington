          <p>I got movement of a player using arrow keys. On top of that I was able to get the player to collide with a fence. I also got the camera to follow my character. I haven't yet figured out how to confine the camera to the map.</p>

            <p>Recently figured out how to connect Unity with my code editor, Visual Code Studio. Involved downloading the right .net and mono framework. I'm still in the process of finding a good tutorial for what I'm looking for. The good part though is that I've become more comfortable with Unity, specifically colliders and tilemaps.</p>

            <p>This is the first obstacle in the process. I've been watching multiple tutorials on movement because I wanted to make a change to the system. However, the new movement script is not compiling and is filled with multiple errors. Some good news is that I found a free art pack that is the style I will need for my final game. It is a more modern looking tile pack with chairs, desks, tables, etc. My next goal will be to get movement working and an interaction system working.</p>

            <p>I have reverted back to a previous movement script that actually works now. Now I need to get collision working again. I guess this is what I get for diverting from what I had previously.</p>
