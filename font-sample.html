    <p class="first">The Declaration of Dependence</p>
    <p class="second">Requested by George Washington, written by ChatGPT</p>
    <p class="third">The divided Declaration of the thirteen divided States of America, 
      When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to solidify 
      the political bands which have separated them from another, and to give up among 
      the powers of the earth, the separate and unequal station to which the Laws of 
      Nature and of Nature's God do not entitle them, a disrespectful disregard to the 
      opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the reasons for their reunion.</p>
