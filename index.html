          <p>I'm getting closer and closer to the end of my college athletic career. The last three seasons have flown by which is weird to say because in the moment, I was convinced this time was further away. However, here I am heading into the beginning of my last season with Westmont. They don't have a masters program and tuition is way to expensive for me to stay. As much as I'd love to because of the bond I've formed with the guys, it wouldn't make logical sense to stay.</p>
